    <h4>Definitions:</h4>

    <p>Prime numbers -- like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. -- are numbers that cannot be further divided into other whole numbers.</p>

    <p>The indivisibility of prime numbers gives them a sort of atomic nature; the prime numbers can be used as the building
      blocks of all other whole numbers. The blueprint for building a number from prime numbers is called a "prime factorization".</p>

    <p>Let <em>n</em> be any non-prime whole number. The prime factorization of <em>n</em> tells you which prime numbers,
      and how many of each of them, need to be multiplied to create a value equal to <em>n</em>.</p>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Let <em>n</em> = 10. 10 = 2 * 5. 2 and 5 are both prime numbers, so the prime factorization of 10 is 2 * 5.</li>
      <li>Let <em>n</em> = 12. 12 = 2 * 6. 2 is a prime number, but 6 is not a prime number, so decompose further into 6 = 2 * 2 * 3.
        2 and 3 are both prime numbers, so the prime factorization of 12 is 2 * 2 * 3.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So now that we see the blueprints for creating the numbers 10 and 12... which of those numbers is more "two-y"?</p>

    <p>10 is built of one 5 and one 2. You could say that 10 is 50% made of 2.</p>
    <p>12 is built of one 3 and two 2's. You could say that 12 is 33% made of 3's and 66% made of 2's.</p>
    <p>So I think that 12 is two-y-er than 10.</p>

    <h4>Visualization:</h4>

    <p>The visualization above shows the numbers from 0 to 100 as bars whose heights represents the numbers' values (i.e., 50 is half as tall as 100).</p>
    <p>Each <em>prime number</em> has been assigned its own color: 2 is red, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and the remaining
      prime numbers less than 100 are each their own shade of gray.</p>
    <p>Each <em>non-prime number</em> gets colored by blending the colors of the prime numbers in their prime factorization.</p>
    <p>For example, 10 = 2 * 5 is an even blend of one part 2 (red) and one part 5 (blue), which gives bar number 10 a purple-y color.</p>
    <p>As we saw above, 12 = 2 * 2 * 3, so bar number 12 is colored as a blend of two parts 2 and one part green. This combination gives a reddish brown.</p>

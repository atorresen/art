  <p><em>Too Much To Wear</em> was exhibited in the University of Michigan's Shapiro Gallery
    as part of ZeroWaste.Org's 2025 Zero Waste Week.</p>

  <p>There are enormous costs hidden behind the clothes that we display
    in our closets and on our bodies. Through extraction of natural resources,
    pollution from manufacturing processes, reliance on plastic-based materials
    and unethical labor practices, and massive emissions from shipping and
    transporting textiles along their supply chain, fast fashion plays a
    big role in the climate crisis.

  <p>And that’s before it even hits our news feeds via advertising
    that tells us we should buy clothes to show that
    we value how we look, and then is discarded when we no longer want to
    wear what we have purchased. Once we get a sense of the damage that the
    production of clothes is doing to the planet,
    it becomes <span style="color: black">too much for us to wear</span>.
  </p>

  <p>Everything in this exhibit is constructed from textile waste sourced
    from thrift stores who had deemed the items unsellable (to be “donated
    for recycling”, sold to “third world countries,” or sent to landfills).
    The textiles and supporting research from ZeroWaste.Org, ECO-UM and the
    University of Michigan’s Planet Blue Student Leaders illustrate the hidden
    environmental costs behind fast fashion.
